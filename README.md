# FinalProject
The quiz works by asking the user a question related to SDG-3, with the use of javascript, html, and css styles. There will be 5 questions, with 4 multiple choices. After the user chooses all of their answers, they will press the "Submit" button, in order to see their score. If they got the question correct, there will be a text in green saying that they got it correct. If they got the question wrong, there will be a text in red saying that they got it wrong.
